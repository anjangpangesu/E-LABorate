### Languages
We use two programming languages to develop the backend of the e-LABorate application.

### Tools
We use multiple tools in the development of the e-LABorate application.

### Libraries
Here are a brief overview of some libraries in the backend development of the e-LABorate application. 

    Data Store:
    -   Save Session User: Used to save user data and share it across different activities or components in the application. It helps in maintaining user session information and providing easy access to user-related data. 
    
    Live Data & View Model:
    -   LiveData: Used to hold and observe data that can be observed for changes. It's typically used in combination with ViewModel to provide reactive and lifecycle-aware data updates to the UI components.
    -   ViewModel: Used to manage and store UI-related data. It holds the data required by the UI components and survives configuration changes, such as screen rotations. ViewModels provide a separation between the UI and data handling logic.

    Retrofit2 & Okhttp3:
    -   Retrofit2: A popular library used for making network requests and handling API interactions. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests, serializing/deserializing data, and processing API responses.
    -   OkHttp3: An HTTP client library used as the underlying network layer for Retrofit. OkHttp3 provides features such as  request/response interception, caching, and efficient connection pooling.

    View Binding & Glide:
    -   View Binding: An Android feature that allows for more efficient and type-safe access to views in XML layouts. It generates a binding class for each XML layout, which eliminates the need for using findViewById and provides direct access to views. 
    -   Glide: An image loading and caching library for Android. It simplifies the process of loading images from various sources (local, remote, or content providers) and handles caching, resizing, and displaying images efficiently.

    MVVM & Clean Code: 
    -   MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): A software architecture pattern that separates the UI (View) from the underlying data (Model) by  introducing a ViewModel layer. It promotes separation of concerns and provides a more maintainable and testable codebase.
    -   Clean Code: A set of principles and practices for writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and enhance. It focuses on code readability, simplicity, and adhering to software design principles, such as SOLID and DRY. Clean code helps improve code quality, collaboration, and overall software development process.
