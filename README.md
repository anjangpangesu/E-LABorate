### Abstract
Before the pandemic, people would go to the laboratory to carry out various tests ranging from blood, cholesterol, antibody tests and numerous other tests. Usually, patients would wait for hours or even several days for their test results and they have to get their test results at the lab. After receiving their test results, they will visit health institutions such as hospitals or clinics to for diagnosis from the laboratory test result. 

However, during COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of laboratory test demand increased and caused people to line up for hours to get their tests done. This might have caused discomfort for some people because of fear and concern of getting infected at the laboratory. To solve this problem, we came up with an idea to create an e-LABorate application. So this app is created to help people lessen their time at the lab, decreasing COVID-19 infection rate. Moreover, people can book lab sessions and their test results instantly on their phones. This app also provides nearest doctor recommendations on the app which could give patients their diagnosis based on the lab results. Another feature from this app is that patients can buy medicine based on the given prescription.

### Project Schedule
The following is a project schedule for making the e-LABorate application.

### Tools
We use multiple tools in the development of the e-LABorate application:
-   Figma
-   Visual Studio Code
-   Android Studio
-   Google Colab
-   Google Cloud Platform
-   Postman
-   GitHub
-   Notion
-   

### Frameworks
We also use a couple of frameworks that help in the development stage.
-   Express.js: We use Express.js for backend and API development, such as route creation, middleware creation, request/error handling, database integration, etc.
-   FastAPI
-   

### Library
Here are a brief overview of some libraries in the development of the e-LABorate application.
1.  Machine Learning
2.  Mobile Development
3.  Cloud Computing
    
    Node.js:
    -   bcrypt: Encrypt and compare user passwords.
    -   crypto: To perform hash, encryption, and decryption.
    -   dotenv: This package is useful for storing other configurations of the application.
    -   firebase-admin: Provides access to the Firebase services from the Node.js server side.
    -   joi: Helps in validating user input data.
    -   jsonwebtoken: It is utilized to secure the API and store user information in a verifiable token.
    -   nodemailer: To send an email from Node.js.
    -   winston: It helps to log application activities and assists in monitoring and diagnosing the application.
    
    FastAPI:
    -  numpy: To perform numerical computation.
    -  pydantic: Defines the data model with automatic validation, parsing, and data transformation.
    -  firebase-admin: Provides access to the Firebase services from the Python server side.

### Service
The services that we utilize to develop and run this application are listed below.
-   Google App Engine: To deploy Node.js based API and backend services.
-   Google Cloud Run: To deploy FastAPI based API and machine learning model.
-   Google Cloud Storage: To store images.
-   Cloud Firestore: To store, manage, and access application data.
-   

### Application
TBD
