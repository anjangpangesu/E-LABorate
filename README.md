### Abstract
Before the pandemic, people would go to the laboratory to carry out various tests ranging from blood, cholesterol, antibody tests and numerous other tests. Usually, patients would wait for hours or even several days for their test results and they have to get their test results at the lab. After receiving their test results, they will visit health institutions such as hospitals or clinics to for diagnosis from the laboratory test result. 

However, during COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of laboratory test demand increased and caused people to line up for hours to get their tests done. This might have caused discomfort for some people because of fear and concern of getting infected at the laboratory. To solve this problem, we came up with an idea to create an e-LABorate application. So this app is created to help people lessen their time at the lab, decreasing COVID-19 infection rate. Moreover, people can book lab sessions and their test results instantly on their phones. This app also provides nearest doctor recommendations on the app which could give patients their diagnosis based on the lab results. Another feature from this app is that patients can buy medicine based on the given prescription.

### Project Schedule
The following is a project schedule for making the e-LABorate application.
