### Language
We use two programming languages to create the backend of the e-LABorate application:
|            Name           |        Implementation of      |         Documentation        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------ |------------------------------|
| Node.js                   | Create All API, ex: Diagnosis | https://nodejs.org/en/docs   |
| Python                    | Create Diagnosis API          | https://docs.python.org/3.9/ |

### Tools
We use multiple tools in the development of the e-LABorate application:

|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Visual Studio Code        | Text Editor                | https://code.visualstudio.com/download |
| Google Cloud Platform     | Deploy Backend Application | https://console.cloud.google.com/      |
| Postman                   | Testing Backend API        | https://www.postman.com/downloads/     |

### Frameworks
We also use a couple of frameworks that help in the development stage.
-   Express.js: We use Express.js for backend and API development, such as route creation, middleware creation, request/error handling, database integration, etc.
-   FastAPI: we use FastAPI for deploy the machine learning model

### Library
Here are a brief overview of some libraries in the backend development of the e-LABorate application. 

    Node.js:
    -   bcrypt: Encrypt and compare user passwords.
    -   crypto: To perform hash, encryption, and decryption.
    -   dotenv: This package is useful for storing other configurations of the application.
    -   firebase-admin: Provides access to the Firebase services from the Node.js server side.
    -   joi: Helps in validating user input data.
    -   jsonwebtoken: It is utilized to secure the API and store user information in a verifiable token.
    -   nodemailer: To send an email from Node.js.
    -   winston: It helps to log application activities and assists in monitoring and diagnosing the application.
    
    FastAPI:
    -  numpy: To perform numerical computation.
    -  pydantic: Defines the data model with automatic validation, parsing, and data transformation.
    -  firebase-admin: Provides access to the Firebase services from the Python server side.

### Service on GOogle Cloud Platform
The services that we utilize to develop and run this application are listed below.
|            Name           |                  Implementation of                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Google App Engine         | To deploy Node.js based API and backend services       |
| Google Cloud Run          | To deploy FastAPI based API and machine learning model |
| Google Cloud Storage      | Testing Backend API                                    |
| Cloud Firestore           | To store, manage, and access application data.         |

### Backend API
Here is an API that we have developed, for those of you who want to try it, please see the documentation.
