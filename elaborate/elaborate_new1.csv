The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) may be low due to: hypochromic and microcytic anemia, including iron-deficiency anemia, anemia due to chronic illnesses, thalassemia; some hemoglobinopathies; occasionally due to hyperthyroidism.

The White Blood Cell count is higher than normal
Leukocytosis (elevated levels of white blood cells) indicates an inflammatory process or acute infections – mostly bacterial ones. A high white blood cell count is not always an indicator of some disease – white blood cells respond to various changes in the body. For instance, stress, pregnancy or exercise may cause an increase in white blood cell counts (leukocytosis). A white blood cell count is generally slightly higher than normal in women before menstruation. Leukocytosis is not typical of viral infections (such as flu, measles, parotitis, viral hepatitis, etc.), in which a high white blood cell count indicates the development of bacterial and other complications, with the exception of viral respiratory diseases, smallpox and other viral infections.

Segmented neutrophil counts are increased
Segmented neutrophil counts are increased (neutrophilia). Perhaps, there is an inflammatory process in the body. A slightly elevated neutrophil count may also be associated with some physiological states, including intense physical activity, smoking, eating, emotional tension, or pregnancy.

High absolute lymphocyte count (absolute lymphocytosis)
An increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (absolute lymphocytosis) often occurs due to viral infections (including the so-called children’s infections, such as whooping cough, measles, German measles, chicken pox, scarlet fever, infectious mononucleosis, mumps, cytomegalovirus infection, etc.). Lymphocytosis may occur during the recovery period after infectious diseases and intoxications. This condition is called postinfectious lymphocytosis and it may last for 2-3 weeks and occasionally even for 1-2 months. Marked postinfectious lymphocytosis has a positive prognostic value indicating the good reactive ability of the lymphatic system that plays an important role in the body’s immunization processes.

Basophil count is above the normal range
An increase in basophil count (basophilia) may indicate a chronic inflammatory process, allergic reactions, is seen in pronounced neutrophil leukocytosis (neutrocytosis), polycythemia, myelosis, after serum injection, as well as during pregnancy, ovulation.",10,3

A high hematocrit may be due to: dehydration (intractable vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burn disease); polycythemia – a disease associated with an increase in red blood cells; insufficient oxygen supply to the tissues, lung diseases, severe heart disease, kidney diseases; pregnancy (erythropoietin is produced causing the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells); bowel obstruction.

The White Blood Cell count is lower than normal
A white blood cell count is lower than normal (leukopenia). A low white blood cell count is an indicator of a weakened immune system. Leukopenia may be caused by some viral infections, such as flu, chicken pox, and German measles, or medications, such as analgesics or anticonvulsant drugs.

The absolute neutrophil count is below the normal range
Numerous factors may cause neutropenia through destruction, decreased production or abnormal storage of neutrophils. A low neutrophil count may be associated with infections (flu, measles, German measles, chicken pox, hepatitis, AIDS), malaria and toxoplasmosis. Rarely, it is caused by medications (cytostatic, anticonvulsant, analgesic drugs). Neutropenia may also be associated with vitamin deficiency (scurvy) and malnutrition in general, as well as vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency. Chronic benign neutropenia may develop in children. Generally, it occurs during the first or second year of life and in most cases goes away on its own as the children reach 2 to 5 years of age.

Hemoglobin level is lower than normal
A condition in which you have a low hemoglobin count is called anemia. Anemia may be caused by iron or vitamin (B12, folic acid) deficiency, blood loss, as well as blood disorders associated with the destruction of red blood cells. Blood transfusion may cause low hemoglobin levels as well. A slightly lower than normal hemoglobin count may be caused by the hormone fluctuations and blood loss associated with the menstrual cycle. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. The best indicators of your body's total iron stores are blood iron level and your serum ferritin level. Iron-deficiency anemia causes pale skin, increased fatigability, general weakness, dyspnea, vertigo, brittle nails and hair, dry skin and mucous membranes.

A slightly low hemoglobin count isn't always a sign of illness – it may be normal for some people. Women who are pregnant commonly have low hemoglobin counts. A slightly lower than normal hemoglobin count may be caused by the hormone fluctuations and blood loss associated with the menstrual cycle. Athletes, especially endurance athletes, tend to have slightly low hemoglobin levels as judged by general population norms. In many cases, a low hemoglobin count is only slightly lower than normal and doesn't affect how you feel. If it gets more severe and causes symptoms, your low hemoglobin count may indicate you have anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. The best indicators of your body's total iron stores are blood iron level and your serum ferritin level. Iron-deficiency anemia causes pale skin, increased fatigability, general weakness, shortness of breath (dyspnea), vertigo, brittle nails and hair, dry skin and mucous membranes.

Low relative lymphocyte count (relative lymphopenia)
Normally, relative lymphopenia occurs in diseases and stages of diseases associated with increased absolute counts of neutrophils (neutrophilia). Therefore, in most cases such relative lymphopenia has no independent diagnostic and prognostic value, however it may indirectly indicate the development of an infectious disease due to an increase in neutrophil counts.",3,2

Hemoglobin level is lower than normal
A condition in which you have a low hemoglobin count is called anemia. Anemia may be caused by iron or vitamin (B12, folic acid) deficiency, blood loss, as well as blood disorders associated with the destruction of red blood cells. Blood transfusion may cause low hemoglobin levels as well. A slightly lower than normal hemoglobin count may be caused by the hormone fluctuations and blood loss associated with the menstrual cycle. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. The best indicators of your body's total iron stores are blood iron level and your serum ferritin level. Iron-deficiency anemia causes pale skin, increased fatigability, general weakness, dyspnea, vertigo, brittle nails and hair, dry skin and mucous membranes.

Eosinophil count is below the normal range
A decrease in eosinophils (eosinopenia) or lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood may be caused by a calculating error in the white blood count. Also, it may be caused by stress or strenuous physical activity. A pathological decrease in the number of eosinophils is an indicator of the body’s weakened immune system and is typically found during the acute stages of all acute infectious diseases. Aneosinophilia (lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood) may be associated with a severe course of those diseases which, when in a mild form, cause eosinophilia (helminth invasion causing severe anemia and consumption) or when these diseases are complicated by some suppurative processes. Aneosinophilia in many chronic infectious diseases and intoxications is considered a negative sign indicating a severe intoxication.

It occurs in children under 10 years old, as well as after strenuous physical activity and during menstruation. Lymphocytosis may occur during the recovery period after infectious diseases and intoxications.

The White Blood Cell count is higher than normal
Leukocytosis (elevated levels of white blood cells) indicates an inflammatory process or acute infections – mostly bacterial ones. A high white blood cell count is not always an indicator of some disease – white blood cells respond to various changes in the body. For instance, stress, pregnancy or exercise may cause an increase in white blood cell counts (leukocytosis). A white blood cell count is generally slightly higher than normal in women before menstruation. Leukocytosis is not typical of viral infections (such as flu, measles, parotitis, viral hepatitis, etc.), in which a high white blood cell count indicates the development of bacterial and other complications, with the exception of viral respiratory diseases, smallpox and other viral infections.

High absolute lymphocyte count (absolute lymphocytosis)
An increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (absolute lymphocytosis) often occurs due to viral infections (including the so-called children’s infections, such as whooping cough, measles, German measles, chicken pox, scarlet fever, infectious mononucleosis, mumps, cytomegalovirus infection, etc.). Lymphocytosis may occur during the recovery period after infectious diseases and intoxications. This condition is called postinfectious lymphocytosis and it may last for 2-3 weeks and occasionally even for 1-2 months.

High absolute monocyte count (absolute monocytosis)
A high count of monocytes (monocytosis) may be found during the recovery period after severe infections and is an indicator of infectious mononucleosis. It may also be associated with many infectious diseases, including measles, chicken pox, German measles, diphtheria, etc. Monocytosis may be indicative of severe infectious diseases, such as sepsis, tuberculosis, some types of leukemia, as well as cancers in the lymphatic system.

High number of eosinophils
An increase in eosinophils (eosinophilia) is most commonly caused by allergic reactions and parasitic diseases (especially parasitic infestations), and may occur during the recovery period after acute infectious diseases (especially bacterial ones). Severe and prolonged eosinophilia is typically caused by parasitic infestations; rarely by protozoa. Eosinophilia is rarely severe if caused by a parasitic infestation of the intestines. Eosinophilia associated with allergic reactions is generally mild, but may be severe in some rare cases, such as, for instance, bronchial asthma or angioneurotic edema. Eosinophils found in the blood in an acute infectious disease are considered one of the signs of the early stages of recovery and are a very good symptom. The percentage of eosinophils continues to grow during the first few days after recovery and may exceed the normal range for a short period of time (postinfectious eosinophilia).

Low RDW-CV
A low RDW is not consistently associated with any hematologic disorder. A low RDW means that the red blood cells vary very little in size. One reason for a low RDW level is macrocytic anemia. Macrocytic anemia is a blood disorder in which not enough red blood cells are produced, but the ones that are present are large. Another cause of a low RDW level is microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia is a condition in which abnormally small red blood cells are present.

A low RDW is not consistently associated with any hematologic disorder. A low RDW means that the red blood cells vary very little in size. One reason for a low RDW level is macrocytic anemia.

Low red blood cell count (erythropenia) could be a symptom of anemia due to blood loss, hemolysis, or vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)and B9 (folic acid) deficiency. Low red blood cell counts are also associated with hydremia which is associated with an intravenous introduction of large amounts of fluid (infusion therapy) or interstitial fluid moving back into the blood vessels as the swelling subsides.

Hemoglobin level is lower than normal
A condition in which you have a low hemoglobin count is called anemia. Anemia may be caused by iron or vitamin (B12, folic acid) deficiency, blood loss, as well as blood disorders associated with the destruction of red blood cells. Blood transfusion may cause low hemoglobin levels as well. A slightly lower than normal hemoglobin count may be caused by the hormone fluctuations and blood loss associated with the menstrual cycle. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. The best indicators of your body's total iron stores are blood iron level and your serum ferritin level. Iron-deficiency anemia causes pale skin, increased fatigability, general weakness, dyspnea, vertigo, brittle nails and hair, dry skin and mucous membranes.

The White Blood Cell count is higher than normal
Leukocytosis (elevated levels of white blood cells) indicates an inflammatory process or acute infections – mostly bacterial ones. A high white blood cell count is not always an indicator of some disease – white blood cells respond to various changes in the body. For instance, stress, pregnancy or exercise may cause an increase in white blood cell counts (leukocytosis). A white blood cell count is generally slightly higher than normal in women before menstruation. Leukocytosis is not typical of viral infections (such as flu, measles, parotitis, viral hepatitis, etc.), in which a high white blood cell count indicates the development of bacterial and other complications, with the exception of viral respiratory diseases, smallpox and other viral infections.

Segmented neutrophil counts are increased
Segmented neutrophil counts are increased (neutrophilia). Perhaps, there is an inflammatory process in the body. A slightly elevated neutrophil count may also be associated with some physiological states, including intense physical activity, smoking, eating, emotional tension, or pregnancy.

Basophil count is above the normal range

Decreased hematocrit levels
A low hematocrit may be due to: severe bleeding; anemia; pregnancy, especially in the second half of pregnancy; increased blood volume (due to the consumption of excessive amounts of water, infusion of excessive amounts of normal saline); decreased production of red blood cells by the bone marrow; increased destruction of red blood cells.

An increased percentage of lymphocytes (relative lymphocytosis) and a low percentage of neutrophils (relative neutropenia) are relative abnormalities, meaning only the percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils is abnormal, while the absolute counts of lymphocytes and neutrophils are within the normal range. These types of lymphocytosis and neutropenia are of no independent diagnostic and prognostic value.

High number of eosinophils
An increase in eosinophils (eosinophilia) is most commonly caused by allergic reactions and parasitic diseases (especially parasitic infestations), and may occur during the recovery period after acute infectious diseases (especially bacterial ones). Severe and prolonged eosinophilia is typically caused by parasitic infestations; rarely by protozoa. Eosinophilia is rarely severe if caused by a parasitic infestation of the intestines. Eosinophilia associated with allergic reactions is generally mild, but may be severe in some rare cases, such as, for instance, bronchial asthma or angioneurotic edema. Eosinophils found in the blood in an acute infectious disease are considered one of the signs of the early stages of recovery and are a very good symptom. The percentage of eosinophils continues to grow during the first few days after recovery and may exceed the normal range for a short period of time (postinfectious eosinophilia).

Physical activity causes an increase in hemoglobin levels.

Even some fresh air may lead to a slight increase in hemoglobin. High hemoglobin levels may be caused by: erythrocytosis (an increase in red blood cell numbers); hemoconcentration; congenital heart disease; bowel obstruction; burns; cardiopulmonary decompensation. Hemoglobin levels in fingerstick blood samples are generally higher than those in venous samples by 3 to 5 g/l. High hemoglobin levels may also be caused by smoking.

Leukocytosis (elevated levels of white blood cells) indicates an inflammatory process or acute infections – mostly bacterial ones. A high white blood cell count is not always an indicator of some disease – white blood cells respond to various changes in the body. For instance, stress, pregnancy or exercise may cause an increase in white blood cell counts (leukocytosis). A white blood cell count is generally slightly higher than normal in women before menstruation. Leukocytosis is not typical of viral infections (such as flu, measles, parotitis, viral hepatitis, etc.), in which a high white blood cell count indicates the development of bacterial and other complications, with the exception of viral respiratory diseases, smallpox and other viral infections.

Segmented neutrophil counts are increased
Segmented neutrophil counts are increased (neutrophilia). Perhaps, there is an inflammatory process in the body. A slightly elevated neutrophil count may also be associated with some physiological states, including intense physical activity, smoking, eating, emotional tension, or pregnancy.

Low relative lymphocyte count (relative lymphopenia)
Normally, relative lymphopenia occurs in diseases and stages of diseases associated with increased absolute counts of neutrophils (neutrophilia). Therefore, in most cases such relative lymphopenia has no independent diagnostic and prognostic value, however it may indirectly indicate the development of an infectious disease due to an increase in neutrophil counts.",7,3

A white blood cell count is lower than normal (leukopenia). A low white blood cell count is an indicator of a weakened immune system. Leukopenia may be caused by some viral infections, such as flu, chicken pox, and German measles, or medications, such as analgesics or anticonvulsant drugs.

The absolute neutrophil count is below the normal range
Numerous factors may cause neutropenia through destruction, decreased production or abnormal storage of neutrophils. A low neutrophil count may be associated with infections (flu, measles, German measles, chicken pox, hepatitis, AIDS), malaria and toxoplasmosis. Rarely, it is caused by medications (cytostatic, anticonvulsant, analgesic drugs). Neutropenia may also be associated with vitamin deficiency (scurvy) and malnutrition in general, as well as vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency. Chronic benign neutropenia may develop in children. Generally, it occurs during the first or second year of life and in most cases goes away on its own as the children reach 2 to 5 years of age. Neutropenia requires no treatment if the child is not sick.

High relative lymphocyte count (relative lymphocytosis)
Relative lymphocytosis (a higher proportion of lymphocytes among the white blood cells) occurs in response to diseases causing a decrease in other types of white blood cells (typically, neutrophils). Relative lymphocytosis has no independent diagnostic value. Lymphocytosis can be physiological. It occurs in children under 10 years old, as well as after strenuous physical activity and during menstruation. Lymphocytosis may occur during the recovery period after infectious diseases and intoxications. This condition is called postinfectious lymphocytosis and it may last for 2-3 weeks and occasionally even for 1-2 months. Marked postinfectious lymphocytosis has a positive prognostic value indicating the good reactive ability of the lymphatic system that plays an important role in the body’s immunization processes.

Low absolute monocyte count (absolute monocytopenia)
A low count of monocytes (monocytopenia) or lack of monocytes in the peripheral blood may develop due to severe pyoinflammatory and infectious diseases. Also, it may be caused by the depressed function of the bone marrow due to bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency anemia).

Eosinophil count is below the normal range
A decrease in eosinophils (eosinopenia) or lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood may be caused by a calculating error in the white blood count. Also, it may be caused by stress or strenuous physical activity. A pathological decrease in the number of eosinophils is an indicator of the body’s weakened immune system and is typically found during the acute stages of all acute infectious diseases. Aneosinophilia (lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood) may be associated with a severe course of those diseases which, when in a mild form, cause eosinophilia (helminth invasion causing severe anemia and consumption) or when these diseases are complicated by some suppurative processes. Aneosinophilia in many chronic infectious diseases and intoxications is considered a negative sign indicating a severe intoxication.",3,3

Hemoglobin level is lower than normal
A condition in which you have a low hemoglobin count is called anemia. Anemia may be caused by iron or vitamin (B12, folic acid) deficiency, blood loss, as well as blood disorders associated with the destruction of red blood cells. Blood transfusion may cause low hemoglobin levels as well. A slightly lower than normal hemoglobin count may be caused by the hormone fluctuations and blood loss associated with the menstrual cycle. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. The best indicators of your body's total iron stores are blood iron level and your serum ferritin level. Iron-deficiency anemia causes pale skin, increased fatigability, general weakness, dyspnea, vertigo, brittle nails and hair, dry skin and mucous membranes.

Low RDW-CV
A low RDW is not consistently associated with any hematologic disorder. A low RDW means that the red blood cells vary very little in size. One reason for a low RDW level is macrocytic anemia. Macrocytic anemia is a blood disorder in which not enough red blood cells are produced, but the ones that are present are large. Another cause of a low RDW level is microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia is a condition in which abnormally small red blood cells are present.

Hemoglobin level is higher than normal
Physical activity causes an increase in hemoglobin levels. Hemoglobin concentrations are higher in mountain climbers and pilots following high-altitude flights, as well as in people living in mountain regions. Even some fresh air may lead to a slight increase in hemoglobin. High hemoglobin levels may be caused by: erythrocytosis (an increase in red blood cell numbers); hemoconcentration; congenital heart disease; bowel obstruction; burns; cardiopulmonary decompensation. Hemoglobin levels in fingerstick blood samples are generally higher than those in venous samples by 3 to 5 g/l. High hemoglobin levels may also be caused by smoking.",9,2

Low RDW-CV
A low RDW is not consistently associated with any hematologic disorder. A low RDW means that the red blood cells vary very little in size. One reason for a low RDW level is macrocytic anemia. Macrocytic anemia is a blood disorder in which not enough red blood cells are produced, but the ones that are present are large. Another cause of a low RDW level is microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia is a condition in which abnormally small red blood cells are present. In these two disorders, the red blood cells do not vary much in size because they are either all small or all large.",9,2

Low relative monocyte count (relative monocytopenia)
A decreased percentage of monocytes in the white blood count (relative monocytopenia) may be found in case of an increase in the concentration of other leukocytes in the blood, such as, for instance, neutrophils and lymphocytes. Relative monocytopenia has no diagnostic value.

Eosinophil count is below the normal range
A decrease in eosinophils (eosinopenia) or lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood may be caused by a calculating error in the white blood count. Also, it may be caused by stress or strenuous physical activity. A pathological decrease in the number of eosinophils is an indicator of the body’s weakened immune system and is typically found during the acute stages of all acute infectious diseases. Aneosinophilia (lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood) may be associated with a severe course of those diseases which, when in a mild form, cause eosinophilia (helminth invasion causing severe anemia and consumption) or when these diseases are complicated by some suppurative processes. Aneosinophilia in many chronic infectious diseases and intoxications is considered a negative sign indicating a severe intoxication.",7,3

Leukocytosis (elevated levels of white blood cells) indicates an inflammatory process or acute infections – mostly bacterial ones. A high white blood cell count is not always an indicator of some disease – white blood cells respond to various changes in the body. For instance, stress, pregnancy or exercise may cause an increase in white blood cell counts (leukocytosis). A white blood cell count is generally slightly higher than normal in women before menstruation. Leukocytosis is not typical of viral infections (such as flu, measles, parotitis, viral hepatitis, etc.), in which a high white blood cell count indicates the development of bacterial and other complications, with the exception of viral respiratory diseases, smallpox and other viral infections.

High absolute monocyte count (absolute monocytosis)
A high count of monocytes (monocytosis) may be found during the recovery period after severe infections and is an indicator of infectious mononucleosis. It may also be associated with many infectious diseases, including measles, chicken pox, German measles, diphtheria, etc. Monocytosis may be indicative of severe infectious diseases, such as sepsis, tuberculosis, some types of leukemia, as well as cancers in the lymphatic system.

High number of eosinophils
An increase in eosinophils (eosinophilia) is most commonly caused by allergic reactions and parasitic diseases (especially parasitic infestations), and may occur during the recovery period after acute infectious diseases (especially bacterial ones). Severe and prolonged eosinophilia is typically caused by parasitic infestations; rarely by protozoa. Eosinophilia is rarely severe if caused by a parasitic infestation of the intestines. Eosinophilia associated with allergic reactions is generally mild, but may be severe in some rare cases, such as, for instance, bronchial asthma or angioneurotic edema. Eosinophils found in the blood in an acute infectious disease are considered one of the signs of the early stages of recovery and are a very good symptom. The percentage of eosinophils continues to grow during the first few days after recovery and may exceed the normal range for a short period of time (postinfectious eosinophilia).",1,3

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) may be high due to: megaloblastic anemia (vitamin B12 folic acid deficiency anemia), non-megaloblastic macrocytosis; anemia due to severe blood loss, chronic hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, sideroblastic anemia, hypothyroidism, liver disorders, and malignant growth dissimilation; oral hormonal contraceptives, as well as postmenopausal periods in women; old age; alcohol abuse, smoking; medications which may cause megaloblastic anemia. 

The White Blood Cell count is lower than normal
A white blood cell count is lower than normal (leukopenia). A low white blood cell count is an indicator of a weakened immune system. Leukopenia may be caused by some viral infections, such as flu, chicken pox, and German measles, or medications, such as analgesics or anticonvulsant drugs.

Eosinophil count is below the normal range
A decrease in eosinophils (eosinopenia) or lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood may be caused by a calculating error in the white blood count. Also, it may be caused by stress or strenuous physical activity. A pathological decrease in the number of eosinophils is an indicator of the body’s weakened immune system and is typically found during the acute stages of all acute infectious diseases. Aneosinophilia (lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood) may be associated with a severe course of those diseases which, when in a mild form, cause eosinophilia (helminth invasion causing severe anemia and consumption) or when these diseases are complicated by some suppurative processes. Aneosinophilia in many chronic infectious diseases and intoxications is considered a negative sign indicating a severe intoxication.",4,3

High absolute lymphocyte count (absolute lymphocytosis)
An increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (absolute lymphocytosis) often occurs due to viral infections (including the so-called children’s infections, such as whooping cough, measles, German measles, chicken pox, scarlet fever, infectious mononucleosis, mumps, cytomegalovirus infection, etc.). Lymphocytosis may occur during the recovery period after infectious diseases and intoxications. This condition is called postinfectious lymphocytosis and it may last for 2-3 weeks and occasionally even for 1-2 months. Marked postinfectious lymphocytosis has a positive prognostic value indicating the good reactive ability of the lymphatic system that plays an important role in the body’s immunization processes.",10,3

A condition in which you have a low hemoglobin count is called anemia. Anemia may be caused by iron or vitamin (B12, folic acid) deficiency, blood loss, as well as blood disorders associated with the destruction of red blood cells. Blood transfusion may cause low hemoglobin levels as well. A slightly lower than normal hemoglobin count may be caused by the hormone fluctuations and blood loss associated with the menstrual cycle. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. The best indicators of your body's total iron stores are blood iron level and your serum ferritin level. Iron-deficiency anemia causes pale skin, increased fatigability, general weakness, dyspnea, vertigo, brittle nails and hair, dry skin and mucous membranes.

Iron-deficiency anemia causes pale skin, increased fatigability, general weakness, dyspnea, vertigo, brittle nails and hair, dry skin and mucous membranes.

Eosinophil count is above the normal range
A decrease in eosinophils (eosinopenia) or lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood may be caused by a calculating error in the white blood count. Also, it may be caused by stress or strenuous physical activity. A relative decrease in eosinophil count (with a normal absolute eosinophil count) has no diagnostic value. Aneosinophilia (lack of eosinophils in a volume of blood) may be associated with a severe course of those diseases which, when in a mild form, cause eosinophilia (helminth invasion causing severe anemia and consumption) or when these diseases are complicated by some suppurative processes. Aneosinophilia in many chronic infectious diseases and intoxications is considered a negative sign indicating a severe intoxication.",4,0

Leukocytosis (elevated levels of white blood cells) indicates an inflammatory process or acute infections – mostly bacterial ones. A high white blood cell count is not always an indicator of some disease – white blood cells respond to various changes in the body. For instance, stress, pregnancy or exercise may cause an increase in white blood cell counts (leukocytosis). A white blood cell count is generally slightly higher than normal in women before menstruation. Leukocytosis is not typical of viral infections (such as flu, measles, parotitis, viral hepatitis, etc.), in which a high white blood cell count indicates the development of bacterial and other complications, with the exception of viral respiratory diseases, smallpox and other viral infections.

A relative decrease in neutrophils
A relative decrease in segmented neutrophil counts (with a normal absolute count of segmented neutrophils) has no diagnostic value. Generally, it occurs due to an increase in lymphocyte levels.

High absolute lymphocyte count (absolute lymphocytosis)
An increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (absolute lymphocytosis) often occurs due to viral infections (including the so-called children’s infections, such as whooping cough, measles, German measles, chicken pox, scarlet fever, infectious mononucleosis, mumps, cytomegalovirus infection, etc.). Lymphocytosis may occur during the recovery period after infectious diseases and intoxications. This condition is called postinfectious lymphocytosis and it may last for 2-3 weeks and occasionally even for 1-2 months. Marked postinfectious lymphocytosis has a positive prognostic value indicating the good reactive ability of the lymphatic system that plays an important role in the body’s immunization processes.

High absolute monocyte count (absolute monocytosis)
A high count of monocytes (monocytosis) may be found during the recovery period after severe infections and is an indicator of infectious mononucleosis. It may also be associated with many infectious diseases, including measles, chicken pox, German measles, diphtheria, etc. Monocytosis may be indicative of severe infectious diseases, such as sepsis, tuberculosis, some types of leukemia, as well as cancers in the lymphatic system.

An increase in eosinophils (eosinophilia) is most commonly caused by allergic reactions and parasitic diseases (especially parasitic infestations), and may occur during the recovery period after acute infectious diseases (especially bacterial ones). Severe and prolonged eosinophilia is typically caused by parasitic infestations; rarely by protozoa. Eosinophilia is rarely severe if caused by a parasitic infestation of the intestines. Eosinophilia associated with allergic reactions is generally mild, but may be severe in some rare cases, such as, for instance, bronchial asthma or angioneurotic edema. Eosinophils found in the blood in an acute infectious disease are considered one of the signs of the early stages of recovery and are a very good symptom.
